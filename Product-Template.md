## Design and Implementation

| Project Organisation. "*Is the software product directory well organised according to language/platform conventions?  Is there a getting started document present (e.g. README.md)? Is the release accompanied by release notes documenting new features and known bugs?  Can the code be compiled and tested automatically? Can the release be installed automatically?  Is there a user guide within README.md or called USERGUIDE.md.  If the installation is not fully automated are there instructions for this?*" |

| Software Design. "*There is a correspondence between high level design documentation for the project and the organisation of the source code. There is a careful separation of concerns between modules making use of appropriate architectural and design patterns.  Software metrics indicate loosely coupled software and high modularity/cohesion.*" |

| Implementation. "Does the implementation that follows a consistent style? Is there a use of explicit identifiers for modules, methods and variable (as appropriate)? Are functions short and comprehensible with low nesting? Is the level of code documentation <em>appropriate</em> (i.e. neither absent nor excessive) use of program documentation will be highly credited." |
